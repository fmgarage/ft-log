Simple logging to macOS Console.app, to file or to a table.

Requires the MBS plugin. Logging to Console is Mac-only. Contains a copy of our Swiss Army Knife Custom Function for paths conversion and formatting. 

## Getting Started

Please download the example and copy the custom functions to your app. From the Scripts menu turn on logging either to Console.app or to a textfile on your desktop. Everytime you navigate to list and detail view, the action is logged. 

For the documentation of the functions' parameters, take a look their source.

### Using Console.app

We recommend creating a filter to display only MBS messages. Enter 'MBS' into the search field, hit return and change the 'any' selector to 'library', then hit the save button. You can also create a filter for all FileMaker messages using process=FileMaker Pro.
