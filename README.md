# ft-log

Simple logging to macOS Console.app, to file or to a table.

Requires the MBS plugin. Logging to Console is Mac-only. Contains a copy of our Swiss Army Knife Custom Function for paths conversion and formatting. 

## Quick Start

Please download the example and copy the custom functions to your app. From the Scripts menu turn on logging either to Console.app or to a textfile on your desktop. Everytime you navigate to list and detail view, the action is logged. 

For the documentation of the functions' parameters, take a look their source.
